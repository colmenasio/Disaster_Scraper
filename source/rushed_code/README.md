# EXPLANATION


Due to the time constrains of the proyect, a new fork including rushed features was created
 
The scripts in this directory are sort of a patch intended for manually circunventing most of the unfixed issues in the
script.


These scripts:
- Are poorly written
- Misuse methods
- Are horrible performace-wise
- Require a lot of monitoring when running the main file

In other words, this scripts are **SO** rushed and most of the code is so ugly, please don't jugde.
